# RBPS_Asyn_Dep_Noises
This repository contains the Matlab implementations of the two simulation examples in our paper "Rao-Blackwellized Particle Smoothing for Mixed Linear/Nonlinear State-Space Model with Asynchronously Dependent Noise Processes", which will be possibly published in the journal "Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation" . When you use this 
repository, please cite this paper.

To run example 1, run the file "mainexample1.m".

To run example 2, run the file "mainexample2.m".
